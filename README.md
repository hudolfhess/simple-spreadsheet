# Simple SpreadSheet

This project is a hands-on learning experience focused on building a simple spreadsheet application using Next.js, React, and TypeScript. The primary goal is to explore and understand these technologies by creating a functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for spreadsheets.

This application allows users to:

- List all spreadsheets.
- Filter spreadsheets.
- ~~Order spreadsheets.~~
- ~~Create new spreadsheets.~~
- ~~Edit spreadsheet's name.~~
- Update cell values within spreadsheets.
- Utilize basic arithmetic formulas (e.g., +, -, \*, /) within cells.
- Delete spreadsheets.

## Stack

- Next.js: For server-side rendering, routing, and overall application structure.
- React: For building the user interface components.
- TypeScript: For static typing, improving code quality and maintainability.

This project is a work-in-progress and a personal learning playground.
